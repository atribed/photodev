# Photo Developer Timer
A fun little project that generates a countdown timer for developing negatives. Users can pick their developer, and film, along with some other options to start a series of timers that will allow for seemless negative development. 

My least favorite part of the whole process is starting, stopping, and setting new timers. This should make that better.

Work in progress, just threw it up here for now.

### But what are its insides?
Uses Node, Express, and MongoDB to house and access film data. Use some mongoose for building the API. The front-end is just JavaScript. Trying to have some fun here.
